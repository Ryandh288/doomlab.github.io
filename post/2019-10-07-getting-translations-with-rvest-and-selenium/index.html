<p>In this guide, I’ll go over how you can use web scraping <code>rvest</code> and <code>Selenium</code> to get translations from Google Translate. Note: I encourage responsible scraping - I always try to do it with some space between requests. You can only do 5000 characters at a time with the free Google translate. I will say that I tried to do this with just rvest and the predictability of the links for Google translate - but I could not get rvest to pull the right data off the page, so here’s a slightly more difficult approach that appears to work. Happy to hear comments!</p>
<p>First, load the <code>rvest</code> and <code>RSelenium</code> libraries. I wish I could remember precisely what I did to set up <code>RSelenium</code> but I don’t :| there are good tutorials out there if you need help with setting it up.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rvest)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: xml2</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(RSelenium)</code></pre>
<p>Next, put in the text you would like to translate:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>##words
words_translate &lt;- c(&quot;hebben deze van door heet woord maar wat sommige&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This next part controls the browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rsDriver</code> tells you what browser to control/open and gets the session started. If you get an error that there’s already something open on that port, run <code>rD[[&quot;server&quot;]]$stop()</code> to stop the session and try again.</li>
<li>The second line sets up you at the client for controlling the session.</li>
<li><code>$navigate</code> is exactly how it sounds, go to this page.</li>
<li>When you run these, you will see a browser open, then go to the Google page.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>##an example to show you what&#39;s happening
rD &lt;- rsDriver(browser = &quot;firefox&quot;)
remDr &lt;- rD[[&quot;client&quot;]]
remDr$navigate(&quot;https://translate.Google.com/&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Once you get the page open, this part is a bit harder. You have to figure out the area of the page you want to control. I have used the <code>SelectorGadget</code> plugin for this, as well as right clicking -&gt; inspect element to find the right class ids and also just View Page Source because I understand html. You should start with <code>SelectorGadget</code> if you aren’t familiar with html and css.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$findElement</code> finds a specific area of the page.</li>
<li><code>$sendKeysToElement</code> sends text to the area of the page you found. You can also do things like <code>clickElement</code> to click on a certain area of the page. Note that the <code>\uE007</code> is the Enter key. So, we are filling in our words we want and hitting enter.</li>
<li><code>$getPageSource</code> gets the page source - <code>rvest</code> has <code>read_html</code> but I could not get that to find all the right information to get the translated text back.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>webElem &lt;- remDr$findElement(using = &quot;class name&quot;,&quot;goog-textarea&quot;)
webElem$sendKeysToElement(list(words_translate, &quot;\uE007&quot;))

webpage &lt;-remDr$getPageSource()</code></pre>
<p>Next, you need to translate the page source into something usable. I will say that in theory, <code>html_nodes</code> allows you to specify a specific class id you are looking for (that’s the <code>result-shield</code> stuff), but I could not get that to work. So, I grabbed the text, the class codes, slapped them together, and then sorted it out.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#load dplyr
library(dplyr, quietly = T)

#get all the text
answers &lt;- webpage %&gt;% #your webpage
  unlist() %&gt;% #unlist, as it saves as a list
  read_html() %&gt;% #read the html 
  html_nodes(&quot;div&quot;) %&gt;% #grab all the divs
  html_text() #get the text from those divs

#get the class names
class_names &lt;- webpage %&gt;% 
  unlist() %&gt;% 
  read_html() %&gt;% 
  html_nodes(&quot;div&quot;) %&gt;% 
  html_attrs() %&gt;% #get the attributes, that&#39;s the class codes 
  sapply(function(x) x[1]) #just the first one is good

#get the answer that has this class code
answers[class_names == &quot;result-shield-container tlid-copy-target&quot;][1]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;have this van by hot word but some&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now we have the translation of some top Dutch words. You could loop over a set of translations you want to do, storing them in a data frame, tibble, list, etc. I would recommend a <code>Sys.sleep()</code> between loops to just not make the website angry. I usually use something like <code>Sys.sleep(runif(1,0,5))</code> to get a random sleep time between 0 and 5 seconds.</p>
<p>When you are done be sure to close the remote session/connection:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#close the browser 
remDr$close()
# stop the selenium server
rD[[&quot;server&quot;]]$stop()</code></pre>
<p>The nice thing about this set up is that you could pull the automatic translation here, and then “click” on a different translation using Selenium - you just would have to figure out where to click on the page. I find myself doing a lot of trial and error for clicks, so just play around it with until it clicks where you want.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
