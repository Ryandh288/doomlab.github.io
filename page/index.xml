      <description>Shiny Apps Each Shiny application is listed below, along with any relevant publication information.
MOTE: Magnitude of the Effect  Shiny App GitHub Research Paper This app allows you to calculate many effect sizes and their confidence intervals. We have included mean differences and variance overlap effect sizes, their formulas, easy to copy output in APA style, help videos on how to use our app, and code for R users.</description>

      <description>Here, you can learn about our goal of making statistical analysis approachable by creating a plethora of learning materials and interactive environment for learning/improving your skills.
Shiny Apps: I have been working on building interactive applications through Shiny to visualize the data for specific projects and to increase statistical skills by creating easy ways to calculate numbers for non-programming researchers. I try to post about the applications as we put them online, but you can find them on our shiny-server GitHub repository or through the shiny tag on the blog.</description>

      <description>Professionally Speaking I am currently an Associate Professor of Psychology at Missouri State University. MSU is the second largest 4 year public university with approximately 25,000 students in Missouri. The Psychology department is fairly large - with nearly 1,000 undergraduate majors (including a double major in gerontology), 30ish full time faculty, and 50-60 graduate students in one of our three tracks (experimental, I/O, clinical). I work closely with the Experimental Psychology track in our master&amp;rsquo;s program and direct the Statistics and Research Design graduate certificate.</description>
